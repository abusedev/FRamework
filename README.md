## FRamework 
<div align="center">
  <h3 align="center">abuse .NET framework</h3>
  <p align="center">
    This is .NET library with many class's for easy use with a ton of pre-written functions that you will likely need with your new C# projects. Instead of creating new class's in your new project(s), you can just add FRamework as a reference!
  </p>

### Installation
1. Open a .NET framework project
2. Right click "References" in the Solution Explorer
3. By default it will usually open Assemblies. Click "Browse" at the bottom to add a custom DLL
4. Browse to the downloaded DLL (or built DLL) and and click OK
5. To use it in your code you can usually do ```csharp
   FRamework.handlers
}
``` and this will show many of the pre-written class's
